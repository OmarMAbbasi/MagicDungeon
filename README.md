# MagicDungeon

## [Live Site](http://omarmabbasi.github.io/MagicDungeon/dist)

### Magic Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler featuring procedurally generated floors built with a recursive backtracking algorithm. 

### The goal of building this was to learn more about CSS animation and see how far I could push a vision using only those and vanilla dom manipulation.

### The game is very much a work in progress and is currently on hiatus pending a large refactor.

### If you wish to experiment, WSAD move the character and moving to the doors will change rooms.
